## Improvements

* The number of files to corrupt and the file size are now user-specified, rather than hard-coded.
* The target directory path is now assigned a default value, rather than being prompted from the user.
* The script now uses a try/catch block to handle any errors that might occur.
* The script now uses splatting to pass parameters to functions.
