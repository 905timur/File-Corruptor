# FileCorruptor

This PowerShell script will corrupt all files in a target directory by writing pseudo data into each file. The files in the target directory will no longer be usable after the script is executed, so use at your own risk!

To use:

1. Save file_corruptor.ps1 and corruptor.bat into the same folder.

2. Execute corruptor.bat

3. The script will ask you to point it to the target directory. 

4. That's it, the files in the target directory are now destroyed.
